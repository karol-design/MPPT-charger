1) Project idea - Stating system requirements and assumptions
2) Pre-design research - Understanding the topic and work that have been already done by others

3) Designing - Designing the first/next version of the system (improving the last design, adding a new level of complexity)
4) Building - Creating a breadbord prototype & suitable software
5) Testing - Testing and analysing the prototype

6) Manufacturing - Final design decisions, schematic and PCB layout files export, ordering all parts and PCBs 
7) Callibration and testing - Basic EVT, DVT and PVT analysis
8) Project results review and conclusions - Final evaluation of the project and its outcomes
