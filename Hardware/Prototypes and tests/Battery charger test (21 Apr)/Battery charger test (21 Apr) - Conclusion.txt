1) Implement a code that would prevent oscillations between Bulk and Float mode (e.g. 10 minutes main loop instead of 1 minute + more accurate BatVoltage measurement that takes into account charging current (low charging current - small voltage subtracted / high charging current - big voltage subtracted)

2) Review and improve setChargingVoltage function (FDBK voltage needed for Float/Bulk mode depends on the current SOC of the battery);

3) Improve BatVoltage measurement (!) and also PVCurrent;

4) Add at least 3 different modes:
	- PV on; Bulk on;
	- PV on; Bulk off;
	- PV off;
